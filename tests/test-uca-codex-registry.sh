# Regression test for PR #11: an npm-owned Codex install must never be
# downgraded by `uca codex`, and a downgrade must never be reported as an
# update.
#
# Background: npm >= 11 honours `min-release-age` from npmrc and bun honours
# `minimumReleaseAge` from bunfig.toml. Under such a gate an `@latest`
# install does not fail; it quietly resolves to the newest version that is
# old enough, which can be OLDER than the installed one (0.153.2 -> 0.151.0
# was reported), and the old update loop then printed "UPDATED: From version
# 0.153.2 to version 0.151.0".
#
# The test stands up a fake npm-owned codex under an isolated HOME with a
# scripted `npm` that behaves like a gated registry, and drives the real
# `uca codex` end to end. No network, nothing real is touched.
#
# Usage: bash tests/test-uca-codex-registry.sh
